id prints the value of memory address of a variable in python
strong memory optimization: if a=10 and b=10 then id(a)=id(b) which shows that no additional memory is allocated
repl is running python from command line with >>> symbol
type()
variables= single value types, multi value types - list, set, tuple, dictionary
list- ordered, mutable,homogenous/heterogenous, [], append, insert; no function for update- just use list[index]=new value; remove takes input of the object, extend-unpacks a list and add,
collections are used for faster processing
    count, multiply operations in list
set=unordered, no duplicate values, mutable; suitable for security because it randomizes the data
tuples=ordered, allows duplicates, immutable
dictionaries=mutable
multiline json format in dictionaries; dictionaries work in same way as lists
